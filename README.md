As part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course in my bachelor's degree, I developed a version of the Arkanoid game with a graphical interface.

The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty and was built using Java in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. During development, I applied several OOP principles:

Polymorphism and inheritance

Basic design patterns (e.g., Observer, Builder)

Generic collections and data structures like ArrayList and linked lists

GUI-based interaction

Game Instructions:

Use 'Up' and 'Down' arrows to navigate the menu

Press 'Enter' to select or start a game

Use 'Left' and 'Right' arrows to control the paddle

Press 'P' to pause

Press 'Space' to resume
